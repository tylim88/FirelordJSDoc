# Thought On Other Wrappers üïØÔ∏è

This section discuss what I think about other wrappers.

I did not go through all the wrapper in details, this is the impression after glancing through their code and documentation.

There is not many serious Typescript wrappers available, the notable ones are `Typesaurus` and `Fireorm`, none of them support Firestore Web V9.

## Typesaurus

Very elegant API, as expected from the author of `date-fns`. Typesaurus is created before Firestore Web V9 and the API somehow resembles V9, the statement _Typesaurus inspired V9 API_ is believe-able.

However despite claiming maximum type safety, it is actually far from it, some types type logic is even hardcoded, for example the `where` clause.

Documentation is not very pleasant to navigate but ok.

Development seem stalled, does not support V9.

## Fireorm

Epic example of how to make thing even more difficult than it is.

Not focusing on type safety but rather focusing on creating OOP way of using Firestore.

Adding tons of API without any real benefit, increasing learning cost for no reason.

Documentation is terrible, some links are broken.

Strongly not recommended, you use you die.

Support only Firestore Admin (Firestore Admin API did not undergo revamp like Firestore Web V9).
