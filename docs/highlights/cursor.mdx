# Cursor üñ±Ô∏è

This section discusses how FirelordJS handle cursor empty rest parameter.

## Empty Rest Parameter üïäÔ∏è

Firestore throw if cursor has no argument, FirelordJS handle it by blocking all non-tuple type and empty tuple type.

Why block empty tuple type?

## Why block Empty Tuple Type?

Because Firestore will throw if cursor don't have any argument.

## Why block Array Type?

In order to make certain rule typing work, FirelordJS need to know the position of each argument, array type does not hold such information.

## What if the arguments is computed?

It is not possible to represent computed arguments as tuple type, it will result in array type.

So yeah it will not pass the type check.

It is very to use computed value as cursor arguments, in case you **really need it**, then ignore the type error with `// @ts-expect-error`

And dont worry about the computed arguments being an empty array, in such case FirelordJS will remove the cursor, there will be no runtime error.

Example:

```ts
// @ts-expect-error
query(colRef, endAt()) // reduce to query(colRef)
// @ts-expect-error
query(colRef, endAt(...[])) // reduce to query(colRef)
```
