# Before You Read üê§

This section will not touch on conventional type safe mechanism (value type safe) because it is a basic quality every wrapper should have and it is just waste of time reiterate them.

Instead this section focus on advanced type safe techniques that is rarely seen in any kind of wrapper out there.

It is recommend that you be familiar with the original Firestore SDK first, which I believe most people already did, which is why you are here.

You don't need to memorize most of thing here, Typescript will do all the hard works for you, just pay attention to topics that are marked with ü¶ú and ‚ö†Ô∏è legends.

## Exports

FirelordJS export every function found in the Firestore SDK, so you can use them directly.
