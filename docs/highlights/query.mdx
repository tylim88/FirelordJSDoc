## Rules Typing üïäÔ∏è

FirelordJS protects you against Firestore runtime exceptions in your queries on type level.

- In a compound query, range (<, <=, >, >=) and not equals (!=, not-in) comparisons must all filter on the same field

	text="FirelordJS displays what error you make in the hint."
/>

- If you include a filter with a range comparison (<, <=, >, >=), your first ordering must be on the same field

	text="FirelordJS display what field path you should use in the hint."
/>

- You can't order your query by a field included in an equality (==) or (in) clause

	text="FirelordJS displays what error you make in the hint."
/>

- You can use at most one in, not-in, or array-contains-any clause per query. You can't combine in , not-in, and array-contains-any in the same query

	src="https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/query4.png?raw=true"
	text="FirelordJS displays what error you make in the hint."
/>

- You can't combine not-in with not equals !=

	text="FirelordJS displays what error you make in the hint."
/>

- You can use at most one array-contains clause per query. You can't combine array-contains with array-contains-any

<Image
	src="https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/query6.png?raw=true"
	text="FirelordJS displays what error you make in the hint."
/>

- Too many arguments provided to startAt/startAfter/endAt/endBefore(). The number of arguments must be less than or equal to the number of orderBy() clauses

	src="https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/query7.png?raw=true"
	text="FirelordJS displays what error you make in the hint."
/>

- You cannot use more than one '!=' filter (undocumented limitation)
