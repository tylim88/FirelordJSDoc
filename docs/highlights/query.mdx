## Rules Typing

FirelordJS protects you against input exceptions in your queries on type level.

- In a compound query, range (<, <=, >, >=) and not equals (!=, not-in) comparisons must all filter on the same field

- If you include a filter with a range comparison (<, <=, >, >=), your first ordering must be on the same field

- You can't order your query by a field included in an equality (==) or (in) clause

- You can use at most one in, not-in, or array-contains-any clause per query. You can't combine in , not-in, and array-contains-any in the same query

- You can't combine not-in with not equals !=
