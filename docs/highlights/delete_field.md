# Delete Field 🍄

This section discusses how `deleteField` works.

## Deletable Field 🦜

Firestore allow you to use deleteField anytime you want, but inn FirelordJS, field are not deletable by default, you need to assign `deleteField` type in order to use it.

<div  style={{ display:'flex', flexDirection:"column", alignItems:'center' }}>
        <img src='https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/deleteField1.png?raw=true' />
        <small>Firestore</small>
</div>
<br/>

You can delete 'a' field because one of the 'a' field types is 'deleteField'.

<div  style={{ display:'flex', flexDirection:"column", alignItems:'center' }}>
        <img src='https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/deleteField2.png?raw=true' />
        <small>Firestore</small>
</div>
<br/>

This mechanism is needed because if a field is deletable, then it is possibly `undefined` when you read it and the `deleteField` union `undefined` to the field's `read` type.
