# Where And documentId🍒

This section discuss how `where` and field path sentinel `documentId()` types works.

import { Image } from '@site/src/components/Image'

## No Autocomplete for Value 🐧

There is autocomplete for `where`'s field path and operation string parameter, however due to Typescript limitation there is no autocomplete for the value parameter.

FirelordJS will still make sure the value type is correct.

You can access the `MetaType` using **[index accessor](../guides/children_and_metatype#index-accessor-%EF%B8%8F)** to check what type you need.

## Dealing With Literal Types 🐧

When working with literal types, you need `const` assertion in order to infers the type correctly.

	text={`const assertion is needed`}
/>

:::caution

You still need to assert `const` variable as `const`.

	text={`You still need to assert const variable as const`}

## Dealing With Empty Array ⚠️

<Image
	src="https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/where8.png?raw=true"
	text={`FirelordJS forbid never[] but allow correctType[] even if it is empty`}
/>

FirelordJS forbid `never[]` and `[]` to stop you from accidentally assign empty array(never[]) directly, small convenience.

However it is impossible to block empty array if the empty array type is same as the type defined, so FirelordJS handle this in runtime by replacing empty array with `['some long unique value']`.

This prevents runtime exceptions while keeping the query accurate.

:::danger
If you revert back to the original Firestore API, please handle the empty array.

## documentId() 🕊️

:::caution
When working with dield path sentinel `documentId()`, `const` assertion is needed so Typescript can count number of slash and ensure the number of segment is correct.
:::

:::tips
FirelordJS reminds you when you are not using `const` assertion.

	text={`FirelordJS warns you when you are not using const assertion.`}

### Collection 🕊️

When querying a collection by documentId(), you must provide a plain document ID, without any forward slash.

<Image

	text={`FirelordJS displays error mesagae in the hint if it detects any invalid character.`}
/>

### Collection Group 🕊️

When querying a collection group by documentId(), FirelorsJS rejects the value if the value is not a valid full document path.

	text={`FirelordJS displays error mesagae in the hint if it detects path is wrong.`}

	text={`FirelordJS counts and compares the number of slash and displays it in the hint`}
/>

### With OrderBy 🦜

The field path of `documentId()` is `__name__`, this is how you use it with orderBy (for some reason you want to order document by Id).

	text={`Order by document Id`}
