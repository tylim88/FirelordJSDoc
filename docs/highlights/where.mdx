# Where And documentId()🍒

This section discuss how `where` and field path sentinel `documentId()` types works.

## Dealing With Literal Types 🦜

When working with literal types, due of Typescript limitation, you need `const` assertion in order to infers the type correctly, no warnsing from FirelordJS.

:::caution

You still need to do `const` assertion even if you declare `const` variable.

## documentId() 🕊️

When working with dield path sentinel `documentId()`, `const` assertion is needed for the same reason, however in this case FirelordJS warns you when you are not using `const` assertion.

### Collection Reference 🕊️

When querying a collection by documentId(), you must provide a plain document ID, without any forward slash.

### Collection Group 🕊️

When querying a collection group by documentId(), FirelorsJS rejects the value if the value is not a valid full document path.

<Image src='https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/where4.png?raw=true' text={`FirelordJS displays error mesagae in hint if it detects path is wrong.`}/>

### With OrderBy 🕊️

The field path of `documentId()` is is `s__name__`, this is how you use it with orderBy (for some reason you want to order document by Id).
