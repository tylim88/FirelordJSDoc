# Where And documentId()🍒

This section discuss how `where` and field path sentinel `documentId()` types works.

## Dealing With Literal Types 🦜

When working with literal types, due of Typescript limitation, you need `const` assertion in order to infers the type correctly, no warnsing from FirelordJS.

## documentId() 🦜

When working with dield path sentinel `documentId()`, `const` assertion is needed for the same reason, however in this case FirelordJS warns you when you are not using `const` assertion.

### Collection Reference

When querying a collection by documentId(), you must provide a plain document ID, without any forward slash.

### Collection Group

When querying a collection group by documentId(), FirelorsJS rejects the value if the value is not a valid full document path.

### With OrderBy

The field path of `documentId()` is is `s__name__`, this is how you use it with orderBy (for some reason you want to order document by Id).
