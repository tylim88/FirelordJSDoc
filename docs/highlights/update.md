# Update üçÉ

This section discuss general how updates works, we use `updateDoc` in all the example, but it works the same for `batch.update` and `transaction.update`.

<div align='center'>
üïä FirelordJS alters the behavior of Firestore SDK update to become more intuitive.
</div>

## The Dangerous Firestore SDK Update API

There are 2 type issues and 1 critical runtime issue in the original Firestore SDK update API

1. Accept unknown member from stale value, stale value refer to value that is attached to a variable.

2. Accept `undefined` but `undefined` is not a valid Firestore value.

3. And guess what will happens to the code below:

<div align='center'><img src='https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/update2.png?raw=true' /></div>
<div align='center'><small>Do you know the answer?</small></div>
<br/>
The value of `a`, `c` and `e` will be updated, meanwhile `d` will be deleted.

Yup you see that right, `d` is deleted, in an **update** operation.
