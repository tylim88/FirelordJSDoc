# Update üçÉ

This section discuss general how updates works, we use `updateDoc` in all the example, but it works the same for `batch.update` and `transaction.update`.

<div align='center'>
üåà FirelordJS alters the behavior of Firestore SDK <strong>update</strong> to become more intuitive.
</div>

## Dangerous Firestore SDK Update API

There are 2 type issues and 1 critical runtime issue in the original Firestore SDK update API

1. Accept unknown member from stale value, stale value refer to value that is attached to a variable.

2. Accept `undefined` but `undefined` is not a valid Firestore value.

<br/>

3. And guess what will happens to the code below:

<div align='center'><img src='https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/update2.png?raw=true' /></div>
<div align='center'><small>Do You Know What Will Happen After The Code Run?</small></div>
<br/>

The value of `a`, `c` and `e` will be updated, meanwhile `d` will be deleted.

Yup you see that right, `d` is deleted, in an **update** operation.

## The FirelordJS's Way

This is how FirelordJS solve the problems:

<div align='center'><img src='https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/update3.png?raw=true' /></div>
<div align='center'><small>FirelordJS Able to Detect Unknown Member In The Stale Value</small></div>
<br/>

Note 1: FirelordJS detect the unknown member and print out the unknown member in Typescript error message
Note 2: FirelordJS lose precision when dealing with fresh value, instead of highlight only `d`, it highlight everything. However it will still displays the same error message just like it did to the stale value. A small price to pay for salvation.

üåà For the 3rd case, it is only solve-able in runtime. While Firestore not able to handle nested form correctly, but it has no problem with dot notation form, so FirelordJS simply flatten down the data before pass it to Firestore update and that eliminates the problem. What you see will always be what you expect in the database.
