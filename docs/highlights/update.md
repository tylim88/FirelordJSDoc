# Update üçÉ

This page discusses how updates works, we will use `updateDoc` in the example, but it works the same for `batch.update` and `transaction.update`.

## Dangerous Firestore SDK Update API üïäÔ∏è

There are 2 type issues and 1 critical runtime issue in the original Firestore SDK update API.

1. Accept unknown member from stale value, stale value refer to value that is attached to a variable.

2. Accept `undefined` but `undefined` is not a valid Firestore value.

3. And guess what will happens to the code below:

<div align='center'>
    <img src='https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/update2.png?raw=true' /></div>
<div align='center'>
    <small>Do You Know What Will Happen After This Code Run?</small>
</div>
<br/>

The value of `a`, `c` and `e` will be updated, meanwhile `d` will be deleted.

Yup you see that right, `d` is deleted, in an **update** operation, this is terrible because you need extra knowledge in order to be aware of such behavior, in short, it is not intuitive.

Data/field deletion(or any operation) should be done explicitly, a proper way to do so is by assigning a `delete` field value and by looking at the code, even newbie know it is going to delete the field without the need to look into the Firestore documentation.

A very questionable API design by Firestore, truly lack of consideration.

## The FirelordJS's Way üïäÔ∏è

FirelordJS solves all the stated concerns:

<div align='center'>

</div>
<br/>

Note 1: FirelordJS lose precision when dealing with fresh value, instead of highlight only `d`, it highlight everything. However it will still displays the same error message just like it did to the stale value in Note 2. Currently there is no way to overcome this because it is impossible to determine whether a value is stale or fresh on type level, a small price to pay for salvation.

Note 2: FirelordJS detect the unknown member and print out the unknown member in Typescript error message.

Note 3: FirelordJS update allow you to skip member while rejecting `undefined`.

## Circumvent Implicit Data Deletion ‚ö†Ô∏è

How FirelordJS circumvent data deletion? While Firestore not able to handle nested form correctly, it has no issue with dot notation form, so FirelordJS simply flatten down the data before pass it to Firestore update and that eliminates the problem. What you see will always be what you expect in the database, no extra knowledge and attention required.
