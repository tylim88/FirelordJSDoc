# Update üçÉ

This page discusses how updates works, we will use `updateDoc` in the example, but it works the same for `batch.update` and `transaction.update`.

## Dangerous Firestore SDK Update API üïäÔ∏è

There are 2 type issues and 1 critical runtime issue in the original Firestore SDK update API.

1. Accept unknown member from stale value, stale value refer to value that is attached to a variable.

2. Accept `undefined` but `undefined` is not a valid Firestore value.

3. And guess what will happens to the code below:

<div align='center'>
    <img src='https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/update2.png?raw=true' /></div>
<div align='center'>
    <small>Do You Know What Will Happen After This Code Run?</small>
</div>
<br/>

The value of `a`, `c` and `e` will be updated, meanwhile `d` will be deleted.

Yup you see that right, `d` is deleted, in an **update** operation, this is terrible because you need extra knowledge in order to be aware of such behavior, in short, it is not intuitive.

Data/field deletion(or any operation) should be done explicitly, a proper way to do so is by assigning a `delete` field value and by looking at the code, even newbie know it is going to delete the field without the need to look into the Firestore documentation.

:::note

This is a a very questionable API design by Firestore with no proper documentation on such dangerous behavior.

Truly lack of consideration.

## The FirelordJS's Way üïäÔ∏è

FirelordJS solves all the stated concerns:

<div align='center'>
    <img src='https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/update3.png?raw=true' /></div>
<div align='center'>

</div>
<br/>

Note 1: FirelordJS highlight the unknown member of the fresh value.

Note 2: FirelordJS detect the unknown member and print out the unknown member in Typescript error message, the same error message is also shown for fresh value.

Note 3: FirelordJS update allows you to skip member while rejecting `undefined`.

## Circumvent Implicit Data Deletion ‚ö†Ô∏è

How FirelordJS circumvent data deletion? While Firestore not able to handle nested form correctly, it has no issue with dot notation form, so FirelordJS simply flatten down the data before pass it to Firestore update and that eliminates the problem. What you see will always be what you expect in the database, no extra knowledge and attention required.

:::caution

Important, if you want to uninstall FirelordJS and revert back to original Firestore SDK, please replace all the nested form with dot notation form or else your fields may get deleted.

## Why Not Just Drop The Nested Form Support? üïäÔ∏è

_Q: Why not simply forbid developers from using nested form? It would be easier for user to revert back to original Firestore SDK._

The reason is simple: usability.

If FirelordJS allow only dot notation form, then developers have to flatten the object every time he use update API. Developers with normal object all the time, not flatten object, so it is better to keep the nested form for common use cases.
