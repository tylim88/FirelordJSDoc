# Possibly Read As Undefined‚ùì

This section discusses how `PossiblyReadAsUndefined` works.

## Undefined Read Field ü¶ú

Firestore has the flexibility to add any field we want, in case like this, the read type of newly added data is `undefined` if we try to read it from the old data.

And this is not the only reason a field could be missing, insecure data integrity is generally main reason why a data is incomplete.

This is what `PossiblyReadAsUndefined` for, it allows you to read a particular field as `undefined`, here is how you use it.

<div  style={{ display:'flex', flexDirection:"column", alignItems:'center' }}>
        <img src='https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/possiblyReadAsUndefined1.png?raw=true' />
        <small>Union 'a' field's read type with undefined</small>
</div>
