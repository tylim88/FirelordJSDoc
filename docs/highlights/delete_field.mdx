# Delete Field üçÑ

This section discusses how `deleteField` works.

## Deletable Field ü¶ú

Firestore allow you to use `deleteField` anytime you want, but in FirelordJS, field are not deletable by default, you need to assign `deleteField` type in order to use it.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
	<img src="https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/deleteField1.png?raw=true" />
	<small>Only 'a' is deletable</small>
</div>
<br />

You can delete 'a' field because one of the 'a' field types is 'deleteField', this is not the same case with 'b'.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
	<img src="https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/deleteField2.png?raw=true" />
	<small>Union 'a' field's read type with 'undefined'</small>
</div>
<br />

This mechanism is needed because we need to tell FirelordJS if a field is deletable, then its read type is possibly `undefined` and the `DeleteField` union `undefined` to the field's read type.

## Array üïäÔ∏è

If you assign `DeleteField` to array type directly or indirectly, FirelordJS will replaces them with error message.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
	<img src="https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/deleteField3.png?raw=true" />
	<small>directly</small>
</div>

<br />
<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
	<img src="https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/deleteField4.png?raw=true" />
	<small>indirectly</small>
</div>

Explanations:

1. `DeleteField[]`: doesn't make sense and field value is not allowed in array.
2. `[{ a: DeleteField }]`: field value is not allowed in array.

<br />

However it is legal to union `DeleteField` with array type:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
	<img src="https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/deleteField5.png?raw=true" />
	<small>DeleteField | any[]</small>
</div>
<br />

## DeleteField Rule

This is how the rule you need to obey when using original Firestore deleteField:

1. To use deleteField in set operation, you need to set merge to true, or have any merge field(empty array also works).
2. To use deleteField in update operation, you can only use it on top level (no nested object, full dot notation is considered as top level.)

Seriously who designed these APIs, they are terrible!
