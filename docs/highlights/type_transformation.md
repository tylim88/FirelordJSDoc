# Type Transformation ü™∂

This page discusses how FirelordJS transforms your types for various uses internally.

Internally, FirelordJS converts your type into 3 main types for different purpose:

- Read type for getDoc, getDocs and onSnapshot.
- Write type for setDoc and updateDoc.
- Compare type for where and orderBy.

The main types are further transformed for even more specific use cases internally.

Key Points:

- FirelordJS forbids you from increment `numeric literal` type, for obvious reason.

- FirelordJS forbids you from writing `Date` or `Timestamp` into `ServerTimestamp`, because some date time has to be server timestamp, such as `createdAt` and `updatedAt`. However you can overcome this limitation by union `ServerTimestamp` with `Date` and `Timestamp` when you declare the meta type.
