Simple:

1. For starter, you can refactor files in `src/types` folder, especially `src/types/queryConstraintLimitation.ts`.

2. Simplify type logic and remove dead code.

3. Utilizing the latest Typescript feature, like [extends Constraints on infer Type Variables](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-7/#extends-constraints-on-infer-type-variables) to reduce code length.

4. Cover more tests, type tests, run time tests etc etc.

5. You can also work on this documentation.

Hard:

1. Looking for a challenge? Then you can try to implement `mandatory field type`:

- It is a special type that assign (with union) to object member.
- Members with such type become `required` even in `update` operations(all members in update operations are partial by default).
- Practical usage is something like `updatedAt` member that keep track of document last updated time.

2. Query Constraint type affect Read type.
