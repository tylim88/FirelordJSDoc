**Active Attention**: nothing warn you, can only rely on yourself.

**Passive Attention**: Typescript warn you.

Basically you just need to pay extra attention to ‚ö†Ô∏è when removing FirelordJS, the rest will let you know by Typescript.

Here is a list of module with ‚ö†Ô∏è:

1. **[update implicit data deletion](./highlights/update#circumvent-implicit-data-deletion-%EF%B8%8F)**
