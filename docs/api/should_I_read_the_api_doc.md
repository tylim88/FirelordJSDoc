# Should I Read The API Doc?

If you are a masochist, sure, yes, why not, go ahead and do your best, you have my blessing.

If you have the knowledge of the original Firestore SDK API, and you have read the previous sections, you need nothing from this section.

If you are using the library casually and found yourself HAVE to referencing this section, you can open issue on github and suggest improvement on the doc, a library can only be as good as its doc.
