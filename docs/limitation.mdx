# Limitation ðŸ›‘

There are few data type that is not supported by FirelordJS, they are:

1. any data type that can extends `Record<number, unknown>`.
2. tuple, we already have array plus tuple is not a practical data type.
3. interface (is treated as utility type in FirelordJS).
4. class (why you want to do so?).
5. function (why you want to do so?).
