# Limitation

This section list down limitions of FirelordJS due to reason like:

1. unsupported
2. or straight up impossible

## Data Type

1. Record<number, T>
2. tuple.
3. cannot union object type that are created with Type Alias with any other type except PossiblyReadAsUndefined.
4. Record<string, T>

1, 2 and 3 may have some use case but not practical.

4 is in the roadmap.

## Empty Value Handling

1. limit and limitToLast cannot stop computed 0 value, resulting in runtime error.
2. cursor rest argument must be tuple type to work.

1 may has remedy in future, 2 see no possibility to be improved at current stage.
