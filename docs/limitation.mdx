# Limitation 🕊️

There are few data type that is not supported by FirelordJS, they are:

1. any data type that can extends `Record<number, unknown>`.
2. tuple, we already have array plus tuple is not a practical data type.
3. interface and class, you must declare your type with `type`, not `interface` and `class`.
4. function (why you want to do so?).
