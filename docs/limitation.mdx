# Limitation ðŸ›‘

This section list down limitions of FirelordJS due to reason like:

1. unsupported
2. serve as other purpose
3. or straight up impossible

## Data Type

1. any data type that can extends `Record<number, unknown>`.
2. tuple, we already have array plus tuple is not a practical data type.
3. function (why you want to do so?).

1 and 2 may be supported in the future(very unlikely), 3 doesn't make sense to support it

## Declaration

1. interface (is treated as utility type in FirelordJS).
2. class (why you want to do so?).

## Empty Value Handling

1. limit and limitToLast cannot stop computed 0 value, resulting in runtime error.
2. cursor rest argument must be tuple type to work.

1 may has remedy in future, 2 see no possibility to be improved at current stage.
