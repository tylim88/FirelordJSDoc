# Collection Group ðŸª…

This section discusses how `Collection Group` works.

import { Image } from '@site/src/components/Image'

## Dealing With Document Name ðŸ¦œ

Here is how you do it:

```tsx
import { MetaTypeCreator, getFirelord } from 'firelordjs'

type Parent = MetaTypeCreator<
	{
		a: 1
	},
	'a',
	string
>
const firelordParent = getFirelord<Parent>()
const ParentCollectionGroup = firelordParent('a').collectionGroup()
```

So far so good.

What if we are dealing with subcollection where the document ID type is `string`? (which is very a common type for document ID)

```tsx
type Child = MetaTypeCreator<
	{
		a: 1
	},
	'b',
	string,
	Parent
>
const firelordChild = getFirelord<Child>()

const ChildCollectionGroup = firelordChild('a/??????????/b').collectionGroup()
```

What should you replace `??????????` with?

The answer is any string you want as long as it is a valid document ID.

```tsx
const ChildCollectionGroupQuery = firelordChild(
	'a/putAnyStringHere/b'
).collectionGroup()
```

Collection Group care only the last segment Collection ID

in case of `Parent`, it is `a`

in case of `Child`, it is `b`

Collection group doesn't care about document ID at all, so just any character to fill the document ID.
