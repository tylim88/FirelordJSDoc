# Type Conversion

This page discusses how FirelordJS transforms your types for various uses internally.

Type transformation is needed because for read, write and compare operation require or output different data type.

Internally, FirelordJS converts your type into 3 main types for different purpose:

- Read type for getDoc, getDocs and onSnapshot.
- Write type for setDoc and updateDoc.
- Compare type for where and orderBy.

The main types are further transformed for even more specific use cases internally.

Key Points:

- FirelordJS forbids you from increment `numeric literal` type, for obvious reason.

- FirelordJS forbids you from writing `Date` or `Timestamp` into `ServerTimestamp`, because some date time has to be server timestamp, such as `createdAt` and `updatedAt`. However you can overcome this limitation by union `ServerTimestamp` with `Date` and `Timestamp` when you declare the meta type.
