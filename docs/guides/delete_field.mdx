# Delete Field üçÑ

This section discusses how `deleteField` works.

import { Image } from '@site/src/components/Image'

## Deletable Field ü¶ú

Firestore allow you to use `deleteField` anytime you want, but in FirelordJS, field are not deletable by default, you need to assign `deleteField` type in order to use it.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
	<img src="https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/deleteField1.png?raw=true" />
	<small>Only 'a' is deletable</small>
</div>
<br />

You can delete 'a' field because one of the 'a' field types is 'deleteField', this is not the same case with 'b'.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
	<img src="https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/deleteField2.png?raw=true" />
	<small>Union 'a' field's read type with 'undefined'</small>
</div>
<br />

This mechanism is needed because we need to tell FirelordJS if a field is deletable, then its read type is possibly `undefined` and the `DeleteField` union `undefined` to the field's read type.

:::note

FirelordJS does not simply union every type with `undefined` by default, because it degrades developer experience.

## DeleteField Rules üïäÔ∏è

This is how the rule you need to obey when using original Firestore deleteField:

1. To use deleteField in set operation, you need to set merge to true, or have any merge field(empty array also works).

:::info this is how the exception look:

Function setDoc() called with invalid data. deleteField() cannot be used with set() unless you pass {merge:true} (found in field x in document sandBox/mergeTestCase)

:::

2. To use deleteField in update operation, you can only use it on top level (no nested object, full dot notation is considered as top level.). The exceptions:

Function updateDoc() called with invalid data. deleteField() can only appear at the top level of your update data (found in field x in document sandBox/mergeTestCase)

<br />

Seriously who make these APIs, they are terrible! The insimilarity between `set` and `update` are beyond words.

### With FirelordJS üïäÔ∏è

/>

You are safe against `set` no merge options, `set` with { merge:false } and `update` low level exceptions, no room for errors.

## Array üïäÔ∏è

If you assign `DeleteField` to array type directly or indirectly, FirelordJS will replaces them with error message.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
	<img src="https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/deleteField3.png?raw=true" />
	<small>directly</small>
</div>

<br />
<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
	<img src="https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/deleteField4.png?raw=true" />
	<small>indirectly</small>
</div>

Explanations:

1. `DeleteField[]`: doesn't make sense and field value is not allowed in array.
2. `[{ a: DeleteField }]`: field value is not allowed in array.

<br />

However it is legal to union `DeleteField` with array type:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
	<img src="https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/deleteField5.png?raw=true" />
	<small>DeleteField | any[]</small>
</div>
<br />
