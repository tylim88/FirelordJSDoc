## Rules Typing

FirelordJS goes beyond guarding data type, FirelordJS further prevents **[Firestore Query Limitations](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/queries#query_limitations)** and **[Firestore Pagination Limitation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/order-limit-data?hl=en&authuser=0#limitations)** on type level(non invasive).

Confused? Well it is not something that you see in your day to day Typescript, so let us take a look at an example, at how FirelordJS handles this limitation:

<div align="center">
	<i>
		In a compound query, range (&lt, &lt=, &gt, &gt=) and not equals (!=,
		not-in) comparisons must all filter on the same field:
	</i>
</div>
<br />
<Image
	src="https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/query1.png?raw=true"
	text="FirelordJS warn you when you violate the limitation and display related error message in the hint."
/>

If this is left unchecked, you will be greeted with an runtime exception.

FirelordJS stop many exceptions on type level, this including documented, indirectly documented, and undocumented exceptions.

## Persistent And Deep

FirelordJS handles types that are convoluted and seemly impossible to type. Example, one of the exception from Firestore states that:

<div align="center">
	<i>
		When querying a collection group by documentId(), the value provided must
		result in a valid document path, and should has an odd number of segments.
	</i>
</div>

<Image
	src="https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/where5.png?raw=true"
	text={`FirelordJS counts and compares the number of slashes and displays it in the hint`}
/>

Firestore further stricten the rule by checking whether the document full path is correct or not.

## Utilities

FirelordJS also come with utilies, for example able to read all field as `undefined`:

<Image
	src="https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/possiblyReadAsUndefined2.png?raw=true"
	text="FirelordJS union all read field with undefined."
/>

This is useful if you want absolute type safe.
