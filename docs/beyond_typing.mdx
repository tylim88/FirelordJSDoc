## Rules Typing

FirelordJS goes beyond just guarding data type and further prevents **[Firestore Query Limitations](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/queries#query_limitations)** and **[Firestore Pagination Limitation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/order-limit-data?hl=en&authuser=0#limitations)** on type level(non invasive).

Confuse? Well it is something you see in your day to day Typescript, so let us take a look at an example, at how FirelordJS handles this limitation:

<div align='center'>

In a compound query, range (&lt, &lt=, &gt, &gt=) and not equals (!=, not-in) comparisons must all filter on the same field:

</div>
<br/>
<div style={{ display:'flex', flexDirection:"column", alignItems:'center' }}>
    <img src='https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/query1.png?raw=true' />
    <small>FirelordJS warn you when you violate the limitation and display respective limitation as error message in the hint.</small>
</div>
<br/>

If this left uncheck, you will be greeted with an runtime exception. FirelordJS stop many exceptions on type level, this including documented, indirectly documented, and undocumented exceptions.

## Utilities

FirelordJS also come with utilies, for example able to read all field as `undefined`:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
	<img src="https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/img/possiblyReadAsUndefined2.png?raw=true" />
	<small>FirelordJS union all read field with undefined.</small>
</div>
<br />

This is useful for those who want to enforc `undefined` check on every field.
