# Contributing

1. Simplify type logic and remove dead code.

2. Utilizing the latest Typescript feature.

3. Cover more tests, type tests, run time tests etc etc.

4. You can also work on the [documentation](https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc).

5. Implement `mandatory field type`:

- It is a special type that assign (with union) to object member.
- Members with such type become `required` even in `update` operations(all members in `update` operations are partial by default).
- Practical usage is something like `updatedAt` member that keep track of document last updated time.

6. Query Constraint type affect Read type. For example for `query(ref, orderByChild('a'), equalTo(true))`, we can further narrow down the type of child node `a` to only `true`.

7. Functionality test for onDisconnect.

8. Support compile to ESM.

9. New Logo
