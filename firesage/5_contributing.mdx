# Contributing

1. Simplify type logic and remove dead code.

2. Utilizing the latest Typescript feature.

3. Cover more tests, type tests, run time tests etc etc.

4. You can also work on the [documentation](https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc).

5. Implement `mandatory field type`:

- It is a special type that assign (with union) to object member.
- Members with such type become `required` even in `update` operations(all members in `update` operations are partial by default).
- Practical usage is something like `updatedAt` member that keep track of document last updated time.

6. Query Constraint type affect Read type. For example for `query(ref, orderByChild('a'), equalTo(true))`, we can further narrow down the type of child node `a` to only `true`.

7. Functionality test for onDisconnect.

## Running The Source Code

Run `npm i`, then create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add this line:

This library test against both emulator and real Firestore, please allow restriction free read and write in your Firestore rule.

please use dummy Firebase project.

### For FireSageJS(Web):

```
PROJECT_ID="your-firebase-project-id"
```

Despite PROJECT_ID is not a secret, you should hide(don't upload to Github) it because you want to allow restriction free read and write for smooth testing.

### For FireSage(Admin):

```
TYPE="xxx"
PROJECT_ID="xxx"
PRIVATE_KEY_ID="xxx"
PRIVATE_KEY='"xxx"'
CLIENT_EMAIL="xxx"
CLIENT_ID="xxx"
AUTH_URI="xxx"
TOKEN_URI="xxx"
AUTH_PROVIDER_X509_CERT_URL="xxx"
CLIENT_X509_CERT_URL="xxx"
```

Do not expose admin secrets.

Place a copy the `.env` file into `codeForDoc` directory, then run:

1. `npm run d-test` to test development code.
2. `npm run d-b-test` to test built code.
3. `npm run d-p-test` to test published code.
