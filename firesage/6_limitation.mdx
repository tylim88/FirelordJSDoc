# Limitation üêß

This section list down limitions of FirelordJS due to reason unsupported or straight up impossible.

## Data Type

1. does not support numeric literal key eg: `{ 1:'a', 2:'b' }`
2. cannot mix non-numeric key and numeric key eg: `{ 1:'a', b:2 }`
3. Interface

Interface serve as utility type, to avoid conflict, we must declare all data types must with Type.

## Empty Value Handling

1. limit and limitToLast cannot prevent runtime value 0, resulting in runtime error.

It is possible to solve 1 but the solution is too fragile, so not going to work on it.
