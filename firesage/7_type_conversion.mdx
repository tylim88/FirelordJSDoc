# Type Conversion

This page discusses how FireSageJS transforms your types for various uses internally.

Type transformation is needed because read, write and compare operation require or output different data types.

## Conversion Table

| Base              | Read              | Write                   | Compare           |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| `number`          | `number`          | `number` \| `Increment` | `number`          |
| `numeric literal` | `numeric literal` | `numeric literal`       | `numeric literal` |
| `string`          | `string`          | `string`                | `string`          |
| `string literal`  | `string literal`  | `string literal`        | `string literal`  |
| `null`            | `null`            | `null`                  | `null`            |
| `ServerTimestamp` | `number`          | `ServerTimestamp`       | `number`          |

Internally, FireSageJS converts base type into 3 main types for different purpose:

- Read type for `get`, `onChild*`, `onValue` and etc.
- Write type for `set`, `update` and etc.
- Compare type for cursors, `orderBy*` and etc.

The main types are further transformed for even more specific use cases internally.

Key Points:

- FireSageJS forbids you from increment `numeric literal` type, eg: if the type is `1 | 100 | 1000` then we should not be able to increment it from `1` to `2`.

- FireSageJS forbids you from writing `number` into `ServerTimestamp`, because some date time has to be server timestamp, such as `createdAt` and `updatedAt`. However if this is your intention, you can by union `ServerTimestamp` with `number`.

- We can always compare `number` to `ServerTimestamp`.
