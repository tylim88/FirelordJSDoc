# Delete Field

This section discusses how `deleteField` works.

import { Image } from '@site/src/components/Image'

## Deletable Field ðŸ¦œ

Firestore allow you to use `deleteField` anytime you want, but in FirelordJS, field are not deletable by default, you need to assign `deleteField` type in order to use it.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
	<img src="/firelordv2/deleteField1.png" />
	<small>
		Only `a` is deletable because one of the type of `a` is `DeleteField`
	</small>
</div>
<br />

You can delete `a` field because one of the `a` field types is `DeleteField`, this is not the same case with `b`.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
	<img src="/firelordv2/deleteField2.png" />
	<small>DeleteField union `a` field's read type with 'undefined'</small>
</div>
<br />

This mechanism is needed because we need to tell FirelordJS if a field is deletable, its read type is possibly `undefined`.

:::note

FirelordJS does not simply union every type with `undefined` by default, because it degrades developer experience.

## Quirky Official SDK DeleteField

This is the rule you need to obey when using official Firestore SDK deleteField:

1. To use deleteField in set operation, you need to set merge to true, or have any merge field(empty array also works).

:::info this is how the exception look:

Function setDoc() called with invalid data. deleteField() cannot be used with set() unless you pass {merge:true} (found in field x in document sandBox/mergeTestCase)

:::

2. To use deleteField in update operation, you can only use it on top level (no nested object, full dot notation is considered as top level.). The exceptions:

:::info this is how the exception look:

Function updateDoc() called with invalid data. deleteField() can only appear at the top level of your update data (found in field x in document sandBox/mergeTestCase)

Confused? You should.

## With FirelordJS

<Image
	src="/firelordv2/deleteField7.png"
	text="FirelordJS stops you from doing it the wrong way, provide hint and relax certain limitation with internal flatten."
/>

For field union with `DeleteField` type.

With set: no delete operation, trigger type error.

With set merge: delete operation is allowed just like official SDK.

With update: delete operation is allowed for both nested and flatten form.

## Array

If you assign `DeleteField` as array type or as array element type, FirelordJS will replaces them with error message.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
	<img src="/firelordv2/deleteField3.png" />
	<small>illegal: as array type</small>
</div>

<br />
<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
	<img src="/firelordv2/deleteField4.png" />
	<small>illegal: as array element type</small>
</div>

Explanations:

1. `DeleteField[]`: doesn't make sense.
2. `[{ a: DeleteField }]`: field value is not allowed in array regardless of depth.
3. Keep in mind that any field value is illegal inside an array(Firestore undocumented limitation).

<br />

However it is legal to union `DeleteField` with array type, it simply means you can delete property `a`:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
	<img src="/firelordv2/deleteField5.png" />
	<small>DeleteField | any[]</small>
</div>
<br />
