## Dealing With Empty Array ☢️

Firestore admin throw if you supply empty array to `in`, `array-contains-any` and `not-in` operator.

To prevents this runtime error, FirelordJS block `never[]` and `[]` to stop you from accidentally assign empty array(never[]) directly.

However it is impossible to block empty array on type level if the type is type other than `never[]` and `[]`(eg: `string[]`, `number[]`), so FirelordJS handle the empty array at runtime by replacing the empty array with `['some long unique value']`.

This avoids runtime exceptions while keeping the query accurate and always return empty result for `in` comparator and all results for `not-in` comparator.

If you revert back to the official Firestore API, please handle the empty array by yourself.
