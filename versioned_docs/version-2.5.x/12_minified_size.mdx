# Minified Size

To obtain the minified size, we use `rollupjs` with the following configuration:

```ts
import typescript from '@rollup/plugin-typescript'
import { terser } from 'rollup-plugin-terser'

export default {
	input: 'src/index.ts',
	output: {
		dir: 'dist',
		format: 'es', // or 'cjs' for admin
	},
	plugins: [
		typescript({
			tsconfig: 'tsconfig.prod.json',
		}),
		terser(),
	],
}
```

Afterwards, we gzip the resulting JavaScript file to obtain the final size.

To build the minified `js` file, you can run `npm run rollup` in the source code. For information on running the source code for Firelord and FireSage, please see [running the source code](./contributing#running-the-source-code).

Please note that we do not publish the minified file. Instead, we publish the non-minified files, which allow you to view the source code properly in `node_modules`. You can also choose to minify the code yourself using your preferred tool and settings.
