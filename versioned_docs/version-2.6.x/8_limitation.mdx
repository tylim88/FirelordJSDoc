# Limitation üêß

This section discusses limitions of FirelordJS due to reason unsupported or straight up impossible.

## Data Type

1. Record<number, T> or Record<\`${number}\`, T>
   Use Record<steing, T> instead
2. tuple.
   technically possible but why would we want to store a tuple? The only use case that is make sense is to store union of tuple: [1,2,3] | [4,5,6], but still doesn't offer huge advantage over array.
3. union object type with object type.
   technically possible (already in use internally). By utilizing Typesript distributive properties it is possible to generate path for object literal unions field.
   Objects unions type seem to be a good type to have in NoSQL database. However, this is not the case because it brings uncertainty that cannot be handled reasonably. For example, with `{a:number}|{b:string}`, you can set `{a:1}` then update `{b:"x"}`, in this case the type is no longer a unions type but an intersection type: `{a:number} & {b:string}`. So I will not implement this feature and will remove it from [FireSageJS](https://github.com/tylim88/FireSageJS) too. A better way to solve this is to use [`PossiblyReadAsUndefined`](https://firelordjs.com/guides/possibly_read_as_undefined) label instead.
   :::note
   Multiple types per object also degrade developer experience, because you always need to do [runtime type check](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#working-with-union-types) everytime you read it since you don't know the exact type it returns.

   This is easy with primitive types but unpleasant with object type.

4. union object type with any primitive type, eg" `{x:{a:number}|'string'}`.
   technically possible (already in use internally). By utilizing Typesript distributive properties it is possible to generate path for object literal unions field.
5. Interface
   Reserved for special type

:::info
3 will not be supported, will give the rest deeper thoughts in the future.

## Empty Value Handling

1. limit and limitToLast cannot prevent runtime value 0, resulting in runtime error.
2. cursor rest argument must be tuple type to work.

It is possible to solve 1 but the solution is too fragile, so not going to work on it.

No possible way to improve 2 at current stage because position must be known.
