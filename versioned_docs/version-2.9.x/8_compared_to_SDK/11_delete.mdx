# Delete Field

This section discusses the complexity of`deleteField`.

## Possible exceptions from `DeleteField`.

This is the rule you need to obey when using official Firestore SDK deleteField:

1. To use deleteField with set operation, you need to set merge to true, or have any merge field(empty array also works), else:

:::info this is how the exception look:

Function setDoc() called with invalid data. deleteField() cannot be used with set() unless you pass {merge:true} (found in field x in document sandBox/mergeTestCase)

:::

2. To use deleteField with update operation, you can only use it on top level (no nested object, full dot notation is considered as top level.), else:

:::info this is how the exception look:

Function updateDoc() called with invalid data. deleteField() can only appear at the top level of your update data (found in field x in document sandBox/mergeTestCase)

## With FirelordJS

For field union with `DeleteField` type.

With set: no delete operation, trigger type error.

With set merge: delete operation is allowed just like official SDK.

With update: delete operation is allowed for both nested and flatten form.

## `DeleteField` And Array

If you assign `DeleteField` as array type or as array element type, FirelordJS will replaces them with error message.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
	<img src="/firelordv2/deleteField3.png" />
	<small>illegal: as array type</small>
</div>

<br />
<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
	<img src="/firelordv2/deleteField4.png" />
	<small>illegal: as array element type</small>
</div>

Explanations:

1. `DeleteField[]`: doesn't make sense.
2. `[{ a: DeleteField }]`: field value is not allowed in array regardless of depth.
3. Keep in mind that any field value is illegal inside an array(Firestore undocumented limitation).

<br />

However it is legal to union `DeleteField` with array type, it simply means you can delete property `a`:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
	<img src="/firelordv2/deleteField5.png" />
	<small>DeleteField | any[]</small>
</div>
<br />
