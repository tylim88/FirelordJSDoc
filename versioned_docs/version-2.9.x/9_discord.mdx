# Discord

You can find me in the largest Firebase [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/BN2cgc3) community by searching for `Acid Coder` in the `off-topic` channel.

While I may not always be visible, please feel free to leave your questions there and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

Feel free to open [Github issues](https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJS/issues) if you suspect something is not working correctly, it is ok even if you end up being wrong about it because it will help me improve documentation.
