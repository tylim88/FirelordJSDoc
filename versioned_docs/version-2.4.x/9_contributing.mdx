## Running The Source Code

This library is tested against both emulators and real Firestore, so please allow for unrestricted read and write access in your Firestore rules. Also, make sure to use a dummy Firebase project.

To get started, run `npm i`. Then, create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add the following line:

### For FirelordJS(Web):

```
PROJECT_ID="your-firebase-project-id"
```

Do not upload PROJECT_ID because we do not restrict any access to Firestore for smooth testing purposes!

### For Firelord(Admin):

```
TYPE="xxx"
PROJECT_ID="xxx"
PRIVATE_KEY_ID="xxx"
# must enclosed private key with single quotes
# copy everything of private key including the double quotes
PRIVATE_KEY='"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nSOME_SUPERLONG_STRING\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"'
CLIENT_EMAIL="xxx"
CLIENT_ID="xxx"
AUTH_URI="xxx"
TOKEN_URI="xxx"
AUTH_PROVIDER_X509_CERT_URL="xxx"
CLIENT_X509_CERT_URL="xxx"
```

Do not expose admin secrets.

Once you have your `.env` file set up, place a copy of it into the `codeForDoc` directory. Then, you can run the following commands:

1. `npm run d-test` to test development code.
2. `npm run d-b-test` to test built code.
3. `npm run d-p-test` to test published code(You can specify which version to test by changing the `version` in `package.json`).
