# Query Rule Typing

This section discusses about how `query` rules typing works.

## Rules Typing

FirelordJS protects you against Firestore runtime exceptions in your queries on type level.

- In a compound query, range (<, <=, >, >=) and not equals (!=, not-in) comparisons must all filter on the same field

<Image
	src="/firelordv2/query1.png"
	text="FirelordJS displays which query rule you violated in the hint."
/>

- If you include a filter with a range comparison (<, <=, >, >=), your first ordering must be on the same field

<Image
	src="/firelordv2/query2.png"
	text="FirelordJS display what field path you should use in the hint."
/>

- You can't order your query by a field included in an equality (==) or (in) clause

<Image
	src="/firelordv2/query3.png"
	text="FirelordJS displays which query rule you violated in the hint."
/>

- You can use at most one in, not-in, or array-contains-any clause per query. You can't combine in , not-in, and array-contains-any in the same query

<Image
	src="/firelordv2/query4.png"
	text="FirelordJS displays which query rule you violated in the hint."
/>

- You can't combine not-in with not equals !=

<Image
	src="/firelordv2/query5.png"
	text="FirelordJS displays which query rule you violated in the hint."
/>

- You can use at most one array-contains clause per query. You can't combine array-contains with array-contains-any

<Image
	src="/firelordv2/query6.png"
	text="FirelordJS displays which query rule you violated in the hint."
/>

- Too many arguments provided to startAt/startAfter/endAt/endBefore(). The number of arguments must be less than or equal to the number of orderBy() clauses

<Image
	src="/firelordv2/query7.png"
	text="FirelordJS displays which query rule you violated in the hint."
/>

- You cannot use more than one '!=' filter (undocumented limitation)

<Image
	src="/firelordv2/query8.png"
	text="FirelordJS displays which query rule you violated in the hint."
/>
