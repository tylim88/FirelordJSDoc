## Dealing With Empty Array ☢️

<Image

	text={`FirelordJS forbid never[] but allow correctType[] even if it is empty`}
/>

FirelordJS block `never[]` and `[]` to stop you from accidentally assign empty array(never[]) directly, small convenience.

However it is impossible to block empty array on type level if its type is same as the type defined in Meta Type(eg: `string[]`, `number[]`), so FirelordJS handle the empty array in runtime by replacing empty array with `['some long unique value']`.

This prevents runtime exceptions while keeping the query accurate.

:::danger
If you revert back to the official Firestore API, please handle the empty array.
