# Update

This page discusses how update works and its quirks.

We will use `updateDoc` in the example, but it works the same for `batch.update` and `transaction.update`.

There are 2 type safe issues and 1 critical runtime issue in the official Firestore SDK update API.

## Unsafe Type

1. Accept unknown(excess) member from stale value, resulting in storing unnecessary information in Firestore.

:::info

Stale value refer to value that is attached to a variable.

Fresh value refer to value that is not attached to a variable.

:::

2. Accept `undefined` but `undefined` is not a valid Firestore value.

## Implicit Data Deletionü¶§

Guess what will happens to the code below:

<div align="center">
	<img src="https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/firelordv2/update2.png?raw=true" />
</div>
<div align="center">
	<small>Do You Know What Will Happen After This Code Run?</small>
</div>
<br />

The value of `a`, `c` and `e` will be updated, meanwhile `d` will be deleted.

Yup you see that right, `d` is deleted in the **update** operation. This is terrible because it is not intuitive and totally unexpected.

Data/field deletion(or any operation in general) should be done explicitly, a proper way to do so is by assigning a `delete` field value and by looking at the code, even beginner knows it is going to delete the field without the need to look into the Firestore documentation.

:::note

This is a very questionable API design by Firestore with no proper documentation on such dangerous behavior.

Truly lack of consideration.

## Solution To Unsafe Type

FirelordJS solves all the stated concerns:

<div align="center">
	<img src="https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc/blob/main/static/firelordv2/update3.png?raw=true" />
</div>
<div align="center">
	<small>FirelordJS Able to Detect Unknown Member In The Stale Value</small>
</div>
<br />

Note 1: FirelordJS highlight the unknown member of the fresh value.

Note 2: FirelordJS highlight the unknown member of the stale value and print out the unknown member in Typescript error message, the same error message is also shown for the fresh value.

Note 3: Partial But no Undefined. FirelordJS update allows you to skip member while rejecting `undefined`, stopping undefined from entering database(undefined is not a valid data type).

## Solution to Implicit Data Deletion ‚ò¢Ô∏è

How FirelordJS circumvent data deletion? While the official SDK not able to handle nested form correctly, it has no issue with dot notation(flatten) form, so FirelordJS simply flatten down the data before pass it to official SDK update. Your input is always what you expect in the database, with no extra knowledge and attention required.

:::caution

Important, if you want to uninstall FirelordJS and revert to official SDK, please replace all the nested form with dot notation form or else your fields may get deleted due to official SDK behavior.

:::

## Why Not Just Drop The Nested Form Support?

_Q: Why not simply forbid developers from using nested form? It would be easier for user to revert to official SDK._

The reason is simple: usability.

If FirelordJS allows only dot notation form, then developers have to flatten the object by himself, this is not ideal as object literal is a common syntax.
