# Library Exports

FirelordJS wraps and exports every function found in the `@firebase/firestore/dist/index.d.ts`.

:::note
Firelord does not support any function and methods related to `withConverter`.

`withConverter` is runtime data transformer and people often confuse it with compilation type check thinking it can replace static type check, which is apple and orange comparison, `withConverter` can not do anything to improve coding experience.

The reason Firerlord disables `withConverter` is because `Meta Type` should be the single source of truth and if we allow `withConverter`, we have the second source of truth: the returns of `toFirestore` and `fromFirestore`.
