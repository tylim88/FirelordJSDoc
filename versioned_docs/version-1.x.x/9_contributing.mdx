# Contributing

1. For starter, you can refactor files in `src/types` folder, especially `src/types/queryConstraintLimitation.ts`.

2. Simplify type logic and remove dead code.

3. Utilizing the latest Typescript feature, like [extends Constraints on infer Type Variables](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-7/#extends-constraints-on-infer-type-variables) to reduce code length.

4. Cover more tests, type tests, run time tests etc etc.

5. You can also work on the [documentation](https://github.com/tylim88/FirelordJSDoc).

6. Looking for a challenge? Then you can try to implement `mandatory field type`:

- It is a special type that assign (with union) to object member.
- Members with such type become `required` even in `updateDoc` operations(all members in `updateDoc` operations are partial by default).
- Practical usage is something like `updatedAt` member that keep track of document last updated time.

7. Query Constraint type affect Read type. For example for query `where('a', '==', true)`, we can further narrow down the read data type of field `a` to only `true`. <-- this is most likely very difficult to implement

8. Current children are aware of parents but not the other way around, this is needed for admin `listCollections` to works properly

9. Optional members.

## Running The Source Code

Run `npm i`, then create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add this line:

This library test against both emulator and real Firestore, please allow restriction free read and write in your Firestore rule.

please use dummy Firebase project.

### For FirelordJS(Web):

```
PROJECT_ID="your-firebase-project-id"
```

Despite PROJECT_ID is not a secret, we should hide it(don't upload to Github) because we don't want any restriction for smooth testing.

### For Firelord(Admin):

```
TYPE="xxx"
PROJECT_ID="xxx"
PRIVATE_KEY_ID="xxx"
# must enclosed private key with single quotes
# copy everything of private key including the double quotes
PRIVATE_KEY='"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nSOME_SUPERLONG_STRING\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"'
CLIENT_EMAIL="xxx"
CLIENT_ID="xxx"
AUTH_URI="xxx"
TOKEN_URI="xxx"
AUTH_PROVIDER_X509_CERT_URL="xxx"
CLIENT_X509_CERT_URL="xxx"
```

Do not expose admin secrets.

Place a copy the `.env` file into `codeForDoc` directory, then run:

1. `npm run d-test` to test development code.
2. `npm run d-b-test` to test built code.
3. `npm run d-p-test` to test published code(change the `version` in `package.json`` to test the version you want).
