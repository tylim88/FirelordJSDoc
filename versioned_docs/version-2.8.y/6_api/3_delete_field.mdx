# Delete Field

This section discusses how `deleteField` works.

import { Image } from '@site/src/components/Image'

## Deletable Field

Firestore allow you to use `deleteField` anytime you want, but in FirelordJS, field are not deletable by default, you need to assign `deleteField` type in order to use it.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
	<img src="/firelordv2/deleteField1.png" />
	<small>
		Only `a` is deletable because one of the type of `a` is `DeleteField`
	</small>
</div>
<br />

You can delete `a` field because one of the `a` field types is `DeleteField`, this is not the same case with `b`.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
	<img src="/firelordv2/deleteField2.png" />
	<small>DeleteField union `a` field's read type with 'undefined'</small>
</div>
<br />

:::note
This is needed because if a field is deletable, it should be possibly read as undefined.

FirelordJS does not simply union every type with `undefined` by default, because it degrades developer experience.

Hence by default we cannot assume all fields is deletable, it must be stated explicitly.
