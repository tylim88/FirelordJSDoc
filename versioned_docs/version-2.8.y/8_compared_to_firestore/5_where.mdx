# Where

This section discusses `where`'s quirks.

import { Image } from '@site/src/components/Image'

## No Value Autocompletion üêß

No auto complete for the **value** argument(`where` clause third parameter) because we need to make way for more type checks.

This only matter if your value type is literal type. Regardless FirelordJS will still make sure the value type is correct, only autocomplete is missing.

The autocomplete of field path argument(1st parameter) and operation string argument(2nd parameter) are not affected and will work as intended.

## Dealing With Empty Array ‚ò¢Ô∏è

/>

Firestore admin throw if you supply empty array to `in`, `array-contains-any` and `not-in` operator.

To prevents this runtime error, FirelordJS block `never[]` and `[]` to stop you from accidentally assign empty array(never[]) directly.

However it is impossible to block empty array on type level if the type is type other than `never[]` and `[]`(eg: `string[]`, `number[]`), so FirelordJS handle the empty array at runtime by replacing the empty array with `['some long unique value']`.

This avoids runtime exceptions while keeping the query accurate and always return empty result for `in` comparator and all results for `not-in` comparator.

If you revert back to the official Firestore API, please handle the empty array by yourself.
